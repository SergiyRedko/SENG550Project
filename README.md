Please run *rf.ipynb* in GoogleColab to replicate our findings.

You may run this notebook in an environment other than GoogleColab, but expect that you may need to install several modules manually. Just follow the instructions in *rf.ipynb* and error messages.

Please note, this might take a while as there are several ML models to train inside.
